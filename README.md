Top Customers: By calculating the total sales per customer, it is possible to identify top revenue-generating customers, which could be key for customer segmentation and targeting strategies.
Customer Locations: The "State" field indicates the geographic location of customers. This helps in assessing sales performance across different states, allowing the identification of key markets.
3. Product Categories:

5. Potential Dashboard Insights:
From the available data, the following key metrics could be visualized in a dashboard:
